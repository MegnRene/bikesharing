A map was created to show the locations of where the bikes were checked out. The circle size and color correspond to the amount in that area. 

## Summary

From what has been analyzed we can conclude that more males subscribe and use the bike share than any other gender in New York City. 
Also that the bike share is popular for commuting! This analysis can improve by adding age groups as a factor and also comparing different months of the year.
